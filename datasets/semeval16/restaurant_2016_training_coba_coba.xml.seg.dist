a word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the $T$ 's sense of " table turnover " , as whacked as it is , or else .

at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at $T$ you do n't just get your average hot dog .

mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the al di la $T$ .
